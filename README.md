# Intelligentcarparking
A simple web/app application to determine parking possibilities around a selected user destination at a given time.


# Problem Statement for the MVP

If a person is travelling from point A to B at a given time of day (t1), the solution should be able to give 2 things:
- Which and how many parking places are available?
- What are the probabilities of space availability in each one of them?

for a given radius (r) around B at time t2 (ETA).

Precisely, from ML/DS standpoint a multivariate and multi-output regression.

# Background
How about electrons flowing in a complicated power distribution system , talk to each other regarding their status, flow, alarming situations etc?
How about removing the deterministic approach to load flow,OPF other calculations with a predictable (already some commercial solutions exist) realtime feedback system(thats the edge....)?
It sounds cool but the basic need is unmet, electrons are a creation of human mind maybe a reality but definitely not discovered to be talkative.

Lets come to a completely different environment "US"

How about we save money and time?

We all respond in a yes...but how?

Answer-> We need to talk about things which affects us, eventhough we can't....
Thats where we see a possibility of a virtual interface.
An activity mapper and not just a random activity rather something which definitely affects us in real life-> "MOBILITY"
Its saturday,
Lets say you want to take your kids to an Italian restraunt, what do you need? except kids....
Car? there you go ....But oops that time everythings full, you know that...

What did you do? You called the restraunt booked yourself a table, sounds nice right?

You have fuel,keys, grab a kiss from your wife and into that car
You reached, somehow the messy city center, now comes the question 
Whom should I call so I could park easily, without arguing with my wife on how long she has to walk?

Answer-> Google says current traffic situation but unfortunately no parking availability? shit we need data....

How about a plugin to your same google app which you used for navigating, that gives you a possibility of the streets which you could park into?

You get to specify how long you want to walk too...

Most importantly, you can talk to the app, can fine tune it considering you give the information of neighbouring streets with respect to the parking scenarios there

Thats what is interactive maybe you help your friend who wants to park in those streets you drove by....community service is after all not so bad, is it?

Possible features\
COLLECTION:-Data from users, statistical data from websites, vehicle flows in and out(traffic data) from a particular busy street\
